Order posts(posts, any custom post types) using a Drag and Drop Sortable JavaScript. Configuration is unnecessary.

== Description ==

Simple Custom Post Order is a powerful and practical plugin that does both post and page sorting, as well as taxonomy sorting, like categories, tags, and links. On top of that, it fully supports all custom post types that you have on your website or blog (portfolio, gallery, staff, testimonials, etc.).

With a convenient and straightforward drag and drop sortable JavaScript, you can create the exact order of posts and pages that match your heart’s content.

You can do all the sorting and order straight from your WordPress administration. Worth noting, Simple Custom Post Order plugin does not require you to perform any configuration in advance. Just plug and play.

When you disable the plugin, all sortings will fall back to the default one used by WordPress. It doesn’t permanently change ordering, so you need to keep the plugin installed if you want to achieve the custom posts and pages classification that you are after.

Other than that, you are pretty much good to go out of the box. Reordering default posts, custom post types, pages, or taxonomy becomes a piece of cake with Simple Custom Post Order.

It has never been easier to arrange and sort custom post types, pages, posts, gallery items, portfolio items, categories, tags, and any other post, content, or taxonomy type.

Simple Custom Post Order features:

- Arrange posts
- Arrange pages
- Arrange taxonomies such as categories or tags
- Arrange custom post types such as portfolio
- Arrange custom post taxonomies (categories or tags)
